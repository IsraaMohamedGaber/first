## 🧠 Project Overview

This system takes **two 4-bit binary numbers** as input, performs **binary addition**, and displays:

- 4-bit **Sum**
- 1-bit **Carry out**

The logic is implemented through embedded code uploaded into a microcontroller (e.g., PIC16F877A), simulated inside Proteus.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Proteus Design Suite** – for circuit design and simulation
- **MPLAB X / MikroC / Keil** – (optional) for writing and compiling microcontroller code
- **HEX File** – precompiled file ready to be used in the simulation

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `FINALPROJECT.pdsprj` in **Proteus**.
2. Select the microcontroller (e.g., PIC16F877A or ATmega32).
3. Right-click the microcontroller > **Edit Properties**.
4. Load the provided `FINA.hex` file into the program memory section.
5. Run the simulation.
6. Use digital logic switches to input 4-bit numbers.
7. Observe the result (sum and carry) on the connected LEDs or 7-segment displays.
